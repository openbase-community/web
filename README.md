# Web

This repo provides the backbone of all Django webapps/APIs. It is a framework that these webapps/APIs fit into and can rely on, with a shared `settings.py` file, logic regarding users, contact, and email. To add functionality, you can install "app packages", which are pip packages containing one or more Django apps that will automatically have their URLs and models imported.
