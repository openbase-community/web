This `web` Django project is the backbone of all of my other projects. Included in this backbone are Django apps like `users` and `teams` that are shared between all my projects. Pip packages containing Django apps with business logic are defined elsewhere and imported into this backbone project.

TaskIQ is used instead of Celery for tasks.

In general you should try to implement features WITHOUT changing code in `web`.
